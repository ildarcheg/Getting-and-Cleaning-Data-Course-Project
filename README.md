# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
# made by ildarcheg

## The purpose of this repository is to show finished project that demonstrates my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
## The dataset that used in this project is Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.
## run_analysis.R contains the code for preparing the data set for analysis. To perform this script just put the source data in working directory.
## tidyData.txt contains the result of run_analysis.R.
